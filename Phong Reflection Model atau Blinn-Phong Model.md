Hereâ€™s a sample README.md for a project that includes both the Phong Reflection Model and the Blinn-Phong Reflection Model. This file provides an overview, features, usage instructions, and code structure.

# Phong and Blinn-Phong Reflection Models

This project implements two popular lighting models in computer graphics: the **Phong Reflection Model** and the **Blinn-Phong Reflection Model**. These models are used to simulate how light interacts with surfaces, providing realistic rendering of 3D objects.

## Overview

### Phong Reflection Model
- **Ambient Reflection**: Represents the general illumination in the environment.
- **Diffuse Reflection**: Scatters light uniformly in all directions; dependent on the angle of the light source.
- **Specular Reflection**: Creates shiny highlights on surfaces, which vary based on the viewer's position.

### Blinn-Phong Reflection Model
- A modification of the Phong model that uses the half-vector between the light direction and the view direction to calculate specular reflection, resulting in a more natural appearance, especially for shiny surfaces.

## Features

- Implementations of both Phong and Blinn-Phong reflection models.
- Visualization using Java Swing.
- Adjustable material and light properties to observe the effects on rendered surfaces.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- An IDE or text editor (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>

2. Open the project in your IDE or text editor.



Running the Application

1. Compile the Java file:

javac ReflectionModel.java


2. Run the application:

java ReflectionModel



Usage

The application creates a window displaying two squares:

The left square represents the Phong Reflection Model.

The right square represents the Blinn-Phong Reflection Model.


You can modify light and material properties in the code to see how they affect the appearance of the squares.


Code Structure

ReflectionModel.java: Contains the main class implementing both the Phong and Blinn-Phong Reflection Models.

Methods:

calculatePhongColor(): Computes the color of a pixel using the Phong model.

calculateBlinnPhongColor(): Computes the color of a pixel using the Blinn-Phong model.

normalize(): Normalizes a given vector.

dot(): Calculates the dot product of two vectors.

reflect(): Calculates the reflection vector based on the light direction and surface normal.



Example

// Example of calculating colors using both models
Color phongColor = calculatePhongColor(new double[]{0, 0, 1});
Color blinnPhongColor = calculateBlinnPhongColor(new double[]{0, 0, 1});
