Core Android Smartphone Application

Overview

This project aims to develop a core Android application designed for [insert your focus here, e.g., professional service robotics, digital document management, etc.]. The application targets smartphones running Android OS and includes core functionalities like [mention key features such as sensor handling, network communication, document processing].


---

Features

Robotics Integration: Leverages Android sensors (e.g., magnetometer, accelerometer) for robotics control and feedback systems.

Network & IP Management: Handles dynamic and static IP addresses, enabling secure communication over local networks or the internet.

Document Management: Allows for efficient management and processing of digital documents.

Sensor Access: Provides access to hardware sensors such as GPS, magnetometer, and accelerometer for real-time data processing.



---

Requirements

Android Studio (latest version)

SDK Version: [Insert minimum Android SDK version]

Compatible Devices: Smartphones with Android 8.0 (Oreo) and above

Sensors: Device must have GPS, magnetometer, and accelerometer.



---

Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/core-android-smartphone.git


2. Open the project in Android Studio.


3. Sync the project with Gradle files.


4. Connect your Android device and enable developer options.


5. Build and run the project on your device.

Configuration

IP Address Configuration

To handle IP addresses, you can edit the configuration file located at:

src/main/res/xml/network_config.xml

Make sure to update the IP handling logic in the NetworkManager.java file.

Sensor Integration

To configure sensor data for robotics features, the configuration can be found under:

src/main/java/com/yourapp/robotics/SensorManager.java

Here, you can define how sensor data is processed and relayed.


---

Usage

Open the app and navigate to the [desired module, e.g., "Robotics Control"].

For network features, ensure your device is connected to a network, and monitor IP assignments from the "Network" tab.

Access real-time sensor data from the "Sensors" module, which displays accelerometer, GPS, and magnetometer readings.
