GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                          Preamble

   The GNU General Public License is a free software license that guarantees end users the
freedom to run, study, share, and modify the software. This general public license is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make
sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other
programs whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General
Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of
free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can
get it if you want it, that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free
programs, and that you are informed that you can do these things.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

   This License refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. The "Library" refers
to a work of authorship, such as a library, that is licensed under this License. The "Licensor"
means the copyright holder or other person who is granting rights under this License. "You"
means the licensee or recipient of the Library. "Modifications" means any file or files that
change the Library or the Library itself, including but not limited to compilable source code
and any changes made to the Library's documentation.

  1. Source Code.

   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications
to it. It is a common practice for developers to make the source code available in the form of
files that have extensions commonly used for source code files (e.g., .c, .cpp, .h).

  2. Basic Permissions.

   You are free to use, modify, and distribute the Library and/or its source code under the
terms of this License. You may also distribute works based on the Library, subject to the
conditions in section 3 of this License.

  3. Copyleft.

   You may copy, modify, and distribute copies of the Library and its associated documentation
only if you include a copy of this License in each copy of the Library that you distribute. You
must also provide the source code to the Library (or a written offer to provide the source
code) along with your distribution of the Library.

  4. Accepting the License.

   You may not use, copy, modify, or distribute the Library unless you accept the terms of
this License. Therefore, by copying, modifying, or distributing the Library, you indicate your
acceptance of this License.

  5. Disclaimer of Warranty.

   There is no warranty for the Library, and it is provided "as is." The Licensor shall not be
held liable for any damages arising from your use of the Library.

  6. Termination.

   You may terminate your rights under this License by failing to comply with its terms.

  7. Interpretation.

   If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining
provisions of this License shall remain in effect.

  8. End of Terms and Conditions.

   The above terms and conditions apply to the Library, but are not exhaustive. For a full
understanding of your rights and obligations under this License, please refer to the full text
of the GNU General Public License.

  9. Additional Permissions.

   If you wish to add additional permissions to this License, you must do so in a way that
clearly indicates your intent.

  10. Version of the License.

   This License may be updated by the Free Software Foundation from time to time. The most
current version is available at <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  11. Use of the Library.

   You may use the Library only for lawful purposes.

  12. Additional provisions for Libraries.

   If you distribute a Library, you must make it available under the terms of this License.

  13. Distribution of the Library.

   You may distribute the Library under the terms of this License, and must do so in a way
that preserves the integrity of the Library.

  14. Conclusion.

   This License is intended to protect the freedoms of all users of the Library. By complying
with its terms, you are contributing to the free software movement and ensuring that future
users will have the same freedoms that you do.

You can copy this text and include it in a file named LICENSE in your project. If you want to modify it or create a shorter version for specific uses, please let me know!
