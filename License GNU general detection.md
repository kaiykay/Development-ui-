GNU General Public License

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) [year]  [your name or organization]
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free software license, which guarantees end users the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the software. This license is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software and share your changes with others, and that you know you can do these things.

These rights are protected for you by our General Public License. DO NOT assume that this means there is no warranty. The GNU General Public License includes a warranty disclaimer.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a way requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a modified version.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you legally liable (such as distribution, public performance, or public display).

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the work itself, that is included in the normal operation of a computer system, with or without modification, but does not include the work itself.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify it. It must be publicly available and must be licensed under terms that allow for the same distribution and modification as the object code.

2. Basic Permissions.

You are granted the following rights:

a) You can use, copy, and distribute copies of the Program, in any medium, without restriction.

b) You can modify the Program, and copy and distribute the modified Program under the terms of this License.

3. Copyleft.

You must keep intact all notices stating that this License applies to the Program, and all notices of copyright, and that the Program is distributed without any warranty. You must also ensure that the modified versions of the Program are licensed as a whole under this License.

4. Distribution.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; and you keep intact all notices stating that this License applies to the Program.

5. No Warranty.

There is no warranty for the Program. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Program is with you. Should the Program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.

6. Acceptance.

You must accept this License for the use or distribution of the Program.

7. Termination.

If you violate any of the terms of this License, your rights under it automatically terminate.

8. Future Versions.

The Free Software Foundation may publish new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

9. Disclaimer.

There is no warranty for the Program. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Program is with you.

10. Interpretation.

If any part of this License is held invalid or unenforceable, the validity of the remaining parts shall not be affected.
