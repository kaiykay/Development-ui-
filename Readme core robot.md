Overview

This project aims to provide a simple yet powerful core for creating robots that can be adapted to various tasks. It includes the essential components for controlling motors, reading sensors, and performing autonomous tasks.

Key aspects of the project include:

Sensor data processing (e.g., IMU, GPS, LiDAR).

Motor control algorithms.

Path planning and navigation.

Communication with external systems (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).

Support for AI and machine learning models.


Features

Modular Design: Easily add or remove features as needed.

Real-Time Control: Capable of running in real-time environments for low-latency control.

Cross-Platform: Works on a variety of hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino, custom boards).

Simulation Ready: Can be tested in simulation environments before deploying to real hardware.


Architecture

The system is designed around a modular architecture, with the following key components:

1. Control System: Manages the actuators and drives the robot's motors.


2. Sensors: Handles input from devices such as cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and IMUs.


3. Communication: Manages communication between the robot and external devices (e.g., via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth).


4. AI Integration: Optional AI modules for tasks such as image recognition, object detection, or autonomous decision-making.

Installation

1. Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/core-robot.git
cd core-robot


2. Install Dependencies: Depending on your hardware platform, you will need to install specific libraries. For example:

On a Raspberry Pi:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt



3. Set Up the Environment: If you are running this project in a virtual environment, make sure to set it up first:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate



Usage

To run the core robot system:

1. Start the Control System:

python3 src/control/main.py


2. Connect to the Robot: If your robot supports remote control, use the corresponding client application or an API to send commands.


3. Run a Simulation: If testing in a simulated environment, you can run:

python3 src/simulation/run_simulation.py



Supported Hardware

Raspberry Pi: Works with versions 3B+ and higher.

Arduino: Compatible with most Arduino boards for motor control and sensor reading.

ESP32: For Wi-Fi and Bluetooth communication.
