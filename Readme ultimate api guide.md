Before you start using the API, make sure you have the following:

API Key (how to get it, what it does)

Programming Language: Compatibility (e.g., Python, Java, JavaScript, etc.)

Libraries/Dependencies: List the libraries required to run the API.


Installation

To get started, install the API by running:

# Example for Node.js
npm install ultimate-api

Or for Python:

pip install ultimate-api

Authentication

To authenticate your requests, you will need to pass your API key in the headers of each request. Here’s how:

Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>

Example:

curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/v1/resource" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"

Rate Limiting

Our API is rate-limited. You can make 500 requests per hour. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a 429 Too Many Requests response.

  "name": "Sample Resource",
  "description": "This is a sample resource",
  "created_at": "2024-10-24T12:34:56Z"

Example of an error response:

{
  "error": {
    "code": 400,
    "message": "Invalid request parameters."
  }
}
