Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

A server (VPS or dedicated server) with a public IP address.

Root or sudo access to the server.

An installed web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx).

OpenSSL installed for SSL configuration.

SSH client installed on your local machine.


Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo


2. Run the setup script (if available):

chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh



SSL Configuration

1. Generate SSL Certificates: You can generate self-signed certificates for testing or obtain certificates from a Certificate Authority (CA).

openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server.key -out server.crt


2. Configure Your Web Server: Update your web server configuration (e.g., Apache or Nginx) to use SSL.

For Apache:

<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName yourdomain.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /path/to/server.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/server.key
</VirtualHost>

For Nginx:

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/server.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/server.key;

    location / {
        root /var/www/html;
        index index.html index.htm;
    }
}


3. Restart the Web Server:

sudo systemctl restart apache2  # For Apache
sudo systemctl restart nginx      # For Nginx



SSH Configuration

1. Enable SSH on your server: Make sure the SSH service is running.

sudo systemctl start ssh
sudo systemctl enable ssh


2. Modify SSH Configuration: Edit the SSH configuration file to enhance security.

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Recommended changes:

Change the default SSH port (optional).

Disable root login: PermitRootLogin no.

Allow only specific users: AllowUsers yourusername.



3. Restart SSH Service:

sudo systemctl restart ssh



Testing Your Setup

SSL: Access your website via https://yourdomain.com and check for the padlock icon in the address bar.

SSH: Test SSH access from your local machine:

ssh yourusername@yourdomain.com


Troubleshooting

SSL Issues:

Ensure the certificates are correctly pointed in the configuration files.

Check web server error logs for SSL-related errors.


SSH Issues:

Verify the SSH service is running.

Check the firewall settings (ensure port 22 is open).
