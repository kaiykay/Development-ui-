Hereâ€™s a representation of binary code, specifically the binary representation of the phrase "Hello World." Each character is represented by its ASCII value in binary.

"Hello World" in Binary Code

H  ->  01001000
e  ->  01100101
l  ->  01101100
l  ->  01101100
o  ->  01101111
(space) ->  00100000
W  ->  01010111
o  ->  01101111
r  ->  01110010
l  ->  01101100
d  ->  01100100

Full Binary Representation

Putting it all together, "Hello World" in binary looks like this:

01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100000 01010111 01101111 01110010 01101100 01100100

Additional Example: Binary Tree Structure

If you want a binary representation of a simple binary tree structure in a more general sense, here's how you might express the values in a binary format:

Example Binary Tree

4
       / \
      2   6
     / \ / \
    1  3 5  7

Binary Representation of Values

4 -> 00000100

2 -> 00000010

6 -> 00000110

1 -> 00000001

3 -> 00000011

5 -> 00000101

7 -> 00000111


Full Binary Representation of Tree Values

00000100 00000010 00000110 00000001 00000011 00000101 00000111

Summary

Binary code is a way of representing text or data using two states, typically represented as 0s and 1s. Each character in ASCII has a unique binary representation. If you need further examples or a specific binary code for a different purpose, feel free to ask!
