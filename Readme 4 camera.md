Here's a template for a README.md file for a project involving a four-camera system. You can customize it according to your specific project details.

# Four-Camera System

## Overview

The Four-Camera System project is designed to provide comprehensive video capture and monitoring capabilities using four synchronized cameras. This system is ideal for applications in surveillance, broadcasting, sports analysis, and more.

## Features

- **Multi-Camera Support**: Connect and control up to four cameras simultaneously.
- **Synchronized Capture**: Capture footage from all cameras at the same time for seamless integration.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: View live feeds from each camera in real-time.
- **Easy Configuration**: Simple setup process for connecting and configuring cameras.
- **Data Storage**: Store recorded footage locally or on cloud storage.

## Requirements

- **Hardware**:
  - Four compatible cameras (USB, IP, or other interfaces).
  - A computer or server with adequate processing power and storage.
  
- **Software**:
  - Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
  - Required Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, etc. (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/four-camera-system.git
   cd four-camera-system

2. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Connect your cameras to the computer.


4. Run the application:

python main.py



Usage

Launch the application, and the user interface will display the live feeds from each camera.

Use the controls to start/stop recording and switch between camera views.

Configure settings for each camera, such as resolution and frame rate.


Configuration

Configuration settings can be modified in the config.json file. Here are the available settings:

{
  "camera_settings": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "resolution": "1920x1080",
      "frame_rate": 30
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "resolution": "1920x1080",
      "frame_rate": 30
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "resolution": "1920x1080",
      "frame_rate": 30
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "resolution": "1920x1080",
      "frame_rate": 30
    }
  ]
}
