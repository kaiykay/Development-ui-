## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a scalable UI system for iOS applications that can be reused across various projects. The system is designed using **UIKit** or **SwiftUI** (depending on your choice) and offers adaptable components for different screen sizes, including iPhones and iPads.

The system includes customizable UI components like buttons, labels, forms, and animations, providing a seamless user experience while maintaining best practices for iOS development.

## UI System Features

- **Modular Components**: A variety of reusable UI components such as buttons, text fields, and form elements.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts automatically to different screen sizes (iPhone, iPad, etc.).
- **Theming Support**: Supports light and dark mode with dynamic UI updates.
- **Accessibility**: Ensures compatibility with VoiceOver and other accessibility features.
- **Animations**: Provides smooth, built-in animations for transitions and interactions.
- **Custom Layouts**: Easily customize layouts and use Auto Layout or SwiftUIâ€™s layout system for flexibility.

## Installation

To integrate this UI system into your iOS project, follow the steps below:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ios-ui-system.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd ios-ui-system

# Open the project in Xcode
open ios-ui-system.xcodeproj

# If using SwiftUI, ensure you're using Xcode 12 or later

Usage

UIKit Example

To use one of the provided components (e.g., a button) in a UIKit-based project:

let button = UIButton(type: .system)
button.setTitle("Click Me", for: .normal)
button.backgroundColor = .blue
button.setTitleColor(.white, for: .normal)
button.layer.cornerRadius = 10
view.addSubview(button)

SwiftUI Example

For projects using SwiftUI, the usage would look like this:

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {
            print("Button clicked!")
        }) {
            Text("Click Me")
                .padding()
                .background(Color.blue)
                .foregroundColor(.white)
                .cornerRadius(10)
        }
    }
}
