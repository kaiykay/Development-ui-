Features
--------
- Gain full control over your Android device.
- Customize system settings and applications.
- Remove pre-installed bloatware.
- Access and modify system files.

Requirements
------------
- An Android device with an unlocked bootloader.
- A computer with ADB and Fastboot installed.
- USB debugging enabled on the Android device.
- A compatible rooting method for your device model.

Installation
------------
Preparation:
1. Backup Your Data: Rooting can potentially cause data loss. Backup important data before proceeding.
2. Unlock Bootloader: Follow the manufacturer's instructions to unlock the bootloader of your device.

Rooting Methods:
There are various methods to gain root access, including:

1. Using Magisk:
   - Download the latest Magisk ZIP file from the Magisk Releases page (https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases).
   - Flash the Magisk ZIP via a custom recovery (like TWRP):
     adb reboot recovery
   - In TWRP, select "Install" and choose the Magisk ZIP file.
   - Swipe to confirm the flash and reboot.

2. Using SuperSU:
   - Download the latest SuperSU ZIP from the official website.
   - Follow similar steps as for Magisk to flash the ZIP file via TWRP.

3. Using One-Click Root Apps:
   - Some applications allow for one-click rooting. Research and choose a reputable app that supports your device.

Usage
-----
Once rooted, you can use various applications that require root access, such as:
- Titanium Backup: For backing up apps and data.
- Greenify: To manage app background processes.
- AdAway: To block ads system-wide.

To check if your device has been successfully rooted, you can install a root checker app from the Google Play Store.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- Device Won't Boot: If your device fails to boot after rooting, you may need to restore a backup or re-flash the stock firmware.
- Root Access Denied: If you receive errors when trying to access root, ensure that the root manager (e.g., Magisk Manager) is properly installed and granted permissions.
- Incompatible Root Method: Ensure the method you used is compatible with your specific device model.

Important Considerations
------------------------
- Warranty Void: Rooting your device may void the warranty. Check your manufacturer's policy.
- Security Risks: Rooting can expose your device to security vulnerabilities. Be cautious about granting root access to apps.
- System Instability: Some modifications may lead to system instability. Proceed with caution and research changes before applying them.
