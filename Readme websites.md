Getting Started

Follow these instructions to run and test the website on your mobile device.

Prerequisites

Text Editor: Install a code editor such as VSCode or Atom.

Mobile Device: A smartphone or tablet (e.g., Samsung Galaxy, iPhone, etc.).

Web Browser: Any modern browser on the mobile device (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Samsung Internet).

File Transfer Method: A way to transfer the website files to the device:

USB Cable

Cloud services (Google Drive, Dropbox)

File manager apps

Email attachment



Step 1: Create the HTML File

Create a file named index.html in your project folder with the following content:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hello World</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            text-align: center;
            padding: 50px;
            background-color: #f0f0f0;
        }
        h1 {
            color: #4CAF50;
        }
        p {
            color: #333;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to this simple website optimized for mobile devices.</p>
</body>
</html>

Step 2: Transfer the File to the Mobile Device

You can use one of the following methods to transfer the index.html file to your mobile device:

USB Cable: Connect the device to your computer, then drag and drop the file to your phone’s storage.

Cloud Services: Upload the file to Google Drive or Dropbox, and download it onto your device.

Email: Send an email to yourself with the index.html file as an attachment and download it on your phone.


Step 3: Open the File on the Mobile Device

1. Open your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Safari, or Samsung Internet) on your mobile device.


2. Use a file manager or the browser itself to locate the index.html file.

You can type the path of the file in the browser address bar or directly open it from your phone’s file manager.

Testing Responsiveness

To ensure the website is optimized for mobile viewing, the code includes a <meta> tag in the header to adjust the viewport settings.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

This ensures that the webpage scales correctly to fit the mobile device screen size.


---

Optional: Hosting the Website

For easy access and sharing, you can also host your website online using platforms like:

GitHub Pages

Netlify

Vercel



---

Notes

Test the website on multiple browsers to ensure compatibility.

You can expand this basic template by adding more content or JavaScript for interactive features.
