Introduction

IP address detection plays a critical role in various applications such as network management, geolocation, and security monitoring. This project aims to create a robust detection system capable of identifying IP addresses based on input data, such as log files, traffic patterns, or satellite images.

Installation

Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure you have the following:

Python 3.x

Required libraries:

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on your model)

OpenCV (for image processing, if applicable)



Steps to Install

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ip-address-detection.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd ip-address-detection


3. Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt



Usage

Running the Code

To run the detection system, use the following command:

python detect_ip.py --input_path path/to/input_file

Example

Here’s how to use the detection functionality in your Python code:

from model import load_model, detect_ip

# Load the trained model
model = load_model('path/to/saved_model.h5')

# Detect IP addresses from input data
result = detect_ip(model, 'path/to/input_file')
print("Detected IP Addresses:", result)

Data

The project may utilize various data sources for IP address detection. Ensure your input data is formatted correctly. Examples include:

Log files containing IP addresses.

Network traffic data.

Satellite images (if applicable).


Data Structure

data/: Folder containing input data files.

labels.csv: (Optional) CSV file with labeled data for training.


Model Training

Training the Model

To train the detection model, run the following command:

python train.py --data_dir path/to/data --epochs 20 --batch_size 32

Hyperparameters

Learning Rate: 0.001
