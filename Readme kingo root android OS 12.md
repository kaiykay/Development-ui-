Troubleshooting

Root Failed: If the rooting attempt fails, try the following:

Switch between the APK method and the PC method.

Ensure your device has a stable internet connection.

Double-check that USB Debugging is enabled.


Bootloop or Softbrick: If your device is stuck in a bootloop, try entering Recovery Mode (usually by holding the power button + volume down) and performing a factory reset. This will wipe all data, so ensure backups are available.

Post-Root Notes

Use Superuser or Magisk to manage root permissions and hide root from certain apps if necessary.

Rooting increases security risks, so avoid granting root permissions to apps you don't trust.

Some apps, such as banking apps, may not work on rooted devices. Magiskâ€™s Hide feature can help bypass this.
