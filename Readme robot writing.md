Professional Service Robotics Application

Overview

This project is a Professional Service Robotics Application designed for Android, offering advanced features like IP address handling, sensor integration, and autonomous operation capabilities. The goal is to facilitate service-related tasks efficiently through mobile robotics.

Features

Autonomous Navigation: Utilizes sensors and algorithms for self-navigation.

IP Address Management: Built-in tools for handling IP addresses within the network for communication.

Real-time Data Processing: Processes sensory data on the go for decision-making.

Mobile Platform Support: Optimized for Android devices (e.g., Samsung Galaxy A12).

Customizable Modules: Easily extendable modules for different service tasks.


Requirements

Android Device: Tested on Samsung Galaxy A12

Programming Languages: Java/Kotlin for Android development, Python for backend algorithms.

SDK/Tools:

Android Studio

Java Development Kit (JDK)

Robot Operating System (ROS) integration (optional)

Access to network sensors (e.g., GPS, magnetic sensors, cameras)



Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/robotics-app.git


2. Open the project in Android Studio.


3. Sync the Gradle files.


4. Build the app using the following command:

./gradlew build


5. Deploy the APK to your Android device via USB debugging or through the Android Studio emulator.



Usage

1. Setup: Upon launching the app, the user is prompted to configure network settings, including IP address assignment for device-to-device communication.


2. Navigation: The robot can be controlled through a manual interface or switched to autonomous mode for task execution.


3. Sensors: The app uses built-in Android sensors such as the magnetometer for direction and accelerometer for motion tracking.



Architecture

Core Module: Handles the main robot control logic.

Sensor Module: Manages inputs from the device sensors (GPS, accelerometer, magnetometer).

Networking Module: Deals with IP address configuration and remote communication.

Autonomous Module: Implements pathfinding and task automation.


Contributing

1. Fork the repository.


2. Create a new feature branch (git checkout -b feature-xyz).


3. Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add new feature').


4. Push to the branch (git push origin feature-xyz).


5. Open a pull request.
