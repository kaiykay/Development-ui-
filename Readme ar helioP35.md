# AR Development on MediaTek Helio P35 (MT6765)

## Overview

This project demonstrates the development of Augmented Reality (AR) applications optimized for devices running on the MediaTek Helio P35 (MT6765) chipset. The goal is to leverage the Helio P35’s capabilities to build lightweight, high-performance AR experiences for mobile applications.

The project includes examples of AR applications such as object tracking, AR navigation, and interactive 3D models, all of which are tuned to run efficiently on the Helio P35 platform.

## Features

- **Optimized AR Performance**: Custom optimizations for the MediaTek Helio P35 to ensure smooth AR experiences on mid-range mobile devices.
- **ARCore Integration**: Supports Google ARCore for tracking, environmental understanding, and interaction.
- **Lightweight 3D Rendering**: Efficient rendering techniques designed for the Helio P35 GPU.
- **Camera and Sensor Integration**: Utilizes the camera, accelerometer, and gyroscope for immersive AR interactions.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Android applications targeting devices powered by Helio P35.

## Requirements

- **Hardware**:
  - A smartphone or tablet with MediaTek Helio P35 (MT6765) chipset.
  - Camera and sensor access (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope).
  
- **Software**:
  - Android 9.0 (Pie) or higher.
  - Google ARCore SDK.
  - Android Studio (for development).

- **Libraries**:
  - ARCore SDK (install via [ARCore SDK for Android](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/java/quickstart)).
  - OpenGL ES (for 3D rendering).
  - Sceneform (optional for easier 3D handling).

## Installation

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/helioP35-ar-app.git
   cd helioP35-ar-app

2. Open in Android Studio:

Open Android Studio and select the project folder.



3. Install dependencies: Ensure that ARCore and other necessary dependencies are installed by syncing the project in Android Studio (File > Sync Project with Gradle Files).


4. Build the project:

Connect your Helio P35 device via USB, enable USB debugging, and select the device in Android Studio.

Run the app to install it on your device.




Google ARCore Setup

For AR applications to work, your device must support Google ARCore. Most MediaTek Helio P35 devices support ARCore, but make sure to install it from the Play Store if it’s not already installed.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.core

Usage

Running the AR Application

Launch the installed app on your Helio P35 device.

Point the camera at a flat surface to start tracking.

Interact with virtual objects by tapping on the screen.


Customization

You can modify the AR scenes and objects by editing the following files:

/app/src/main/res/sceneform/: Contains 3D model assets for AR scenes.

/app/src/main/java/com/example/ar/ARActivity.java: Handles ARCore session management, object tracking, and rendering.


Performance Optimization for Helio P35

To ensure optimal performance on the Helio P35 platform:

Reduce 3D Model Complexity: Use lightweight models optimized for mobile devices.

Limit ARCore Processing: Minimize heavy background processing, especially when running on battery power.

Efficient Memory Management: Free up memory for rendering by efficiently handling object lifecycles and camera frames.


Known Issues

Some AR features might be less responsive on devices running a lower version of Android.

ARCore calibration may vary based on environmental lighting conditions.

Performance may degrade slightly with high-complexity models due to the GPU limitations of the Helio P35.
