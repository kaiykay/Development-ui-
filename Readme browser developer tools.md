## Overview

Browser Developer Tools (DevTools) are built-in tools in web browsers that allow developers to inspect, debug, and optimize their web applications. This README provides a guide to using these tools effectively for web development.

## Getting Started

To open the Developer Tools in your browser, use the following shortcuts:

- **Google Chrome**: 
  - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + I`
  - Mac: `Cmd + Option + I`
