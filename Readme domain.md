Domain Registration

To set up a domain for your website, follow these steps:

Step 1: Choose a Domain Registrar

Select a domain registrar to purchase your domain. Popular registrars include:

GoDaddy

Namecheap

Google Domains

Bluehost


Step 2: Search for a Domain

Search for an available domain name (e.g., example.com). Choose a name that fits your website purpose and brand.

Step 3: Purchase the Domain

Follow the registrar’s instructions to purchase the domain and set up an account.

DNS Configuration

Once you’ve purchased your domain, you need to configure the DNS settings to point the domain to your website.

Step 1: Access DNS Management

Log in to your domain registrar’s control panel.

Go to the DNS Management or DNS Settings section.


Step 2: Set Up A Records

If you're hosting your website on a specific server or web hosting provider:

Add an A Record that points to your server’s IP address.

Host: @ (for the root domain, e.g., example.com)

Points to: Your server’s IP address (e.g., 123.123.123.123)



Step 3: Set Up CNAME Records (Optional)

If you're using a subdomain or a web hosting platform like GitHub Pages or Netlify:

Add a CNAME Record for the www version of your domain:

Host: www

Points to: Your web hosting service’s address (e.g., your-site.netlify.app)



Step 4: Save and Apply DNS Settings

Once you’ve entered the A and CNAME records, save your changes. It can take up to 24-48 hours for DNS changes to propagate, but usually, it’s much faster.

Website Deployment

Now that your domain is set up, you need to deploy your website. There are different ways to deploy, depending on your hosting provider.

Step 1: Choose a Hosting Provider

You’ll need a place to host your website. Some popular hosting platforms include:

GitHub Pages (for static sites): Free hosting for public repositories.

Netlify: Free hosting for static websites with custom domain support.

Vercel: Hosting with easy integration for modern web projects.

Shared Hosting: Platforms like Bluehost, SiteGround, or GoDaddy.


Step 2: Upload or Deploy Your Website

If using a shared host, upload your website files via FTP or the host’s control panel.

If using a static site host (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel), push your website’s code repository and link it to the host.


Step 3: Link Your Domain

In your hosting provider’s settings, there will be an option to link your custom domain (e.g., example.com) to the hosted website. Follow the instructions to link the domain to your site, ensuring the DNS settings match.

Testing on Mobile Devices

Ensure that your website works correctly on mobile devices such as Samsung Galaxy, iPhones, and tablets.

Step 1: Open the Website on a Mobile Browser

On your Samsung Galaxy or any mobile device, open a browser like Chrome or Safari.

Enter your domain name (e.g., example.com) and check the responsiveness of the website.


Step 2: Use Developer Tools

You can also use Chrome’s Developer Tools (press F12 on desktop, then click on the mobile icon) to test your site’s responsiveness.

Make sure that the website looks and functions well on different screen sizes.

SSL Certificates

To ensure your website is secure, you’ll need an SSL certificate, especially if your website involves handling user data.

Step 1: Choose an SSL Provider

Many domain registrars and hosting providers offer free SSL certificates:

Let’s Encrypt: A free SSL certificate provider supported by many hosts.

Cloudflare: Free SSL with additional performance benefits.


Step 2: Enable SSL

If your hosting provider supports SSL, enable it in the control panel.

Alternatively, follow your hosting provider’s instructions to install an SSL certificate.


Step 3: Update DNS Settings (if needed)

If you’re using a service like Cloudflare, you may need to update your DNS settings to use their SSL service.

Conclusion

Your domain and website should now be fully set up and deployed. You can visit your domain from any browser on mobile or desktop devices to see your website live. Make sure you test your site on various mobile devices and apply SSL for security.
