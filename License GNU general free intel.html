It seems you're looking for a version of the GNU General Public License (GPL) that is specifically formatted or simplified for use with an HTML project, perhaps focusing on Intel-related software or hardware. Below, I will provide a general template that you can use in your HTML project. You can customize it according to your needs:

You can use the following template in your HTML project to indicate that it is licensed under the GNU GPL. This template can be included in a LICENSE file and referenced in your HTML files.

1. LICENSE File Content

Create a file named LICENSE and include the following text:
