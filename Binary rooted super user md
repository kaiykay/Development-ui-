Hereâ€™s a README.md document that provides an overview of a binary rooted super user implementation in C. This document explains the structure and functionality of the code. You can save this as binary_rooted_super_user.md.

# Binary Rooted Super User

## Overview
The Binary Rooted Super User program is implemented in C and demonstrates a binary tree structure to manage user information based on their privilege levels. Each node in the binary tree represents a user, allowing for organized storage and retrieval of user data.

## Structure
The program defines a `UserNode` structure that includes:
- `username`: A string representing the name of the user.
- `privilegeLevel`: An integer indicating the user's privilege level (higher numbers indicate higher privileges).
- Pointers to the left and right child nodes for the binary tree structure.

## Features
- **Node Creation**: Functionality to create a new user node.
- **Insertion**: Ability to insert user nodes into the binary tree based on privilege levels.
- **In-Order Traversal**: A method to print the users in ascending order of their privilege levels.

## Code Implementation

### UserNode Structure
```c
struct UserNode {
    char username[50];
    int privilegeLevel;
    struct UserNode *left;
    struct UserNode *right;
};

Create Node Function

Creates a new user node with the given username and privilege level.

struct UserNode* createNode(char *username, int privilegeLevel);

Insert Function

Inserts a user node into the binary tree based on privilege level.

struct UserNode* insert(struct UserNode* node, char *username, int privilegeLevel);

Print In-Order Function

Displays user information in order of privilege level.

void printInOrder(struct UserNode* node);

Usage

1. Compile the Program: Use a C compiler to compile the code.

gcc binary_rooted_super_user.c -o binary_rooted_super_user


2. Run the Program: Execute the compiled program.

./binary_rooted_super_user


3. Output: The program will display the list of users in order of their privilege levels.



Sample Output

Users in order of privilege level:
Username: User1, Privilege Level: 1
Username: User2, Privilege Level: 2
Username: Admin, Privilege Level: 3
Username: SuperUser, Privilege Level: 4

Conclusion

This program provides a simple implementation of a binary tree for managing users and their privileges. It demonstrates fundamental concepts of data structures in C and can be expanded with additional features such as user deletion and tree traversal methods.

Future Improvements

Implement functions for deleting users from the tree.

Add error handling for user inputs.

Enhance the user interface for better interaction.
